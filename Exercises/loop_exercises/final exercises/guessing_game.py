# Create a game in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 10 (can also expand this to include any number)
# If player guesses too high, tell them they're too high. Too low â€” tell them they're too low
# If they guess correctly, tell them they win, and ask if they want to play again (y/n)
# Break on 'no'
